# Analytics by Babel Street

[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/rosette/api.svg?colorB=bright%20green&style=flat)](https://packagist.org/packages/rosette/api)

Our product is a full text processing pipeline from data preparation to extracting the most relevant information and
analysis utilizing precise, focused AI that has built-in human understanding. Text Analytics provides foundational
linguistic analysis for identifying languages and relating words. The result is enriched and normalized text for
high-speed search and processing without translation.

Text Analytics extracts events and entities — people, organizations, and places — from unstructured text and adds the
structure of associating those entities into events that deliver only the necessary information for near real-time
decision making. Accompanying tools shorten the process of training AI models to recognize domain-specific events.

The product delivers a multitude of ways to sharpen and expand search results. Semantic similarity expands search
beyond keywords to words with the same meaning, even in other languages. Sentiment analysis and topic extraction help
filter results to what’s relevant.
